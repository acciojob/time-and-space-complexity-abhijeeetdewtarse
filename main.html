<h1>Time,Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, quantifying the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It provides a standardized way to analyze and compare the efficient of different algorithms, independent of specific hardware or execution environments</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> denoted as O(n) signifies linear space complexity. This means that the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run grows directly and proportionally with the size of its input, represented by 'n'.</p>
